Typing test with database in electron

## How it works
I wrote an equation / algorithm to calculate the words per minute (wpm). The equation is the number of character's divided by 5 over the minutes.
```javascript
wpm = Math.round((input.value.length / 5) / (seconds / 60));
```
### I kinda got too lazy to finish the readme so. ya.
- If you do use this those, delete the entries in the database.nedb file and run `npm run start`
